# Space Invaders clone

This project is a clone of the widely popular game [Space
Invaders](http://www.spaceinvaders.de/) rebuilt in HTML, CSS and
JavaScript for learning purposes.  So, no extra frameworks or libraries
will be used, just the plain technologies.


## How to use it?

Just clone this repo locally and open the index.html file in your browser.


## Inspiration

The idea for this project came following the videos of the great YouTube
channel [Code with Ania Kub√≥w](https://www.youtube.com/@AniaKubow/videos)
who has already explained some concepts building a simple clone of Space
Invaders [here](https://youtu.be/ec8vSKJuZTk?t=14916).

That project was really helpful and insightful but as long as I started
learning from it my aim was to put my own contributions and modifications
trying to make it a bit more fun and visually appealing.  I'll describe
some of my learning and decision making process in this document as I go
updating it.
